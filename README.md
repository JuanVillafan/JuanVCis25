Description:

Palindrome : A word that is spelled the same forwards and backwards.

I will be working on a palindrome checker, where the user will input a word, and the program will check and output
whether the word is a palindrome or not. This program will not be case sensitive, meaning the program will still work
even if the word looks like, "taCocAt" , it will still output true. My program will also count the length of the word,
and will also let the user know how many times each letter/character repeats, but only if the word is a palindrome.
